*{
  margin:0 (Inside of element container)
  padding:0 (Outside of element container) (Typically will use "gap" from flexbox or grid display instead of padding)
(This removed all initial margin/padding from items)

  box-sizing:border-box;
(This allows the width and height the "box" that is around the content to remain the same
  -When adding margin - boxsize will remain the same, but the content within the box will be reduced to account for margin
        -This is useful because then the layout of your page will remain unchanged when adding margin)
