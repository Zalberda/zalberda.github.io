        <h2>Practice...</h2>
        <p>
          This is my practice place for everything code wise, html, css,
          javascript, etc. There may or may not be completed projects in this
          area, most of the things in this section will be for fun and
          experimental.
        </p>

        <p>
          With everything practice makes perfect, my goal of learning to code
          websites and interaction within the website is to eventually get a job
          or side hustle doing this. My main focus currently is to be able to
          build good looking layouts using flexbox and grid layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently taking courses on Udemy which is really helping me
          learn all of my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan on finishing the html css course, then taking an advanced css
          course, then I will learn java script, then I will begin to learn back
          end development...
        </p>
        <p>
          I also plan on learning how to use python and hopefully will begin to
          create more modern websites.
